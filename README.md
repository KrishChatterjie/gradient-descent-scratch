# Classification using Gradient Descent from scratch

This uses gradient descent to predict whether a tumour is benign or malignant.</br>
There is one hidden layer of neurons with 128 nodes and a single node output layer.

The implementation is from scratch. 
No libraries, other than those for data manipulation were used.

The code follows the documentation on:</br>
